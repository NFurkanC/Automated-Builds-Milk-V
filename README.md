This repository is for compiling Milk V Duo S code on GitHub Actions. Just upload the code to src folder and push. It automatically compiles the code for Milk V Duo S and you can download it.

I will add:
  Configuration selection for milkv duo targets
  ARM and RISC-V selection
  Automatic selection between CMake/Make build systems
  Converting this repo to a template
  Better caching for other types of configurations
